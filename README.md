To send individual bulk whatsapp messages

Good day all,

This is an App that i am working on. I do not claim anything as i would have pulled and source bits and parts from all over then internet.
Download the Entire Repository unto your Desktop or anywhere on yoru PC. Please feel free to contribute and mke this even better.

How to use.

Step 1

First have WhatsApp downloaded and installed on your phone.
I have only tested this App with Android, so IOS users use at your own discretion.

Step 2
Using Google Chrome (set as your default browser)

Go to https://web.whatsapp.com/

You should see something like below with a QR Code

Follow this tutorial here from whatsapp.

Once you have successfully logged into web.whatsapp.com now is when then "magic" starts.

Step 3
Open MPOS folder and run the Mpos.exe

This will get your mouse position. This is key. You need to get your X and Y axis position of your send button.

In the text file name sample, your will enter the Y then X physical cordinates just as how the sample file has them.

Step 4
 
 Now open up the Leads.csv. This is where you will enter your Contact Numbers and Message you wish to send in the format below.

 Save your CSV as a CSV. You may be asked to save in another format, don't.
 
 Step 5
 
 Run newedditedwhatsapp.exe and thats it. It take a little while (about 20 secs depending on your machine to start up).
 
 While the program is running you cannot use your PC. Just watch it do its thing. Once all the messages have been sent, the program will exit automatically.
 
 Please don't your this APP to spam people. Very good for giving personalised messages for Church Members, Employees, Social Groups, ETCS
